# Kickstarter-Analysis
Analyzing data in the Kickstarter workbook 
## Overview of Project
    ***Analyzing data concerning outcomes based on launch date and outcomes based on goals.***

### Purpose
    ***Help Louise determine which goals were met the most and why.***
## Analysis and Challenges
    ***The analysis and challenges were to create a Pivot Table filtered by parent category and years. In the rows section we had to put the Lanuch Date grouped by months and the outcomes as columns and values. Then we had to create a pivot table to show the relationship between outcomes and launch month. For the second challenge we had to use the countifs() functiom to collect the oucome and goal data for the "plays" subcategory. We also had to create a line chart to show the relationship between the goal amount ranges on the horizontal axis and the percantage of successful, failed, or canceled projects on the vertical axis.***
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    ***According to the outcomes based on launch date we can see that the goals were mostly met for successful during the month of April and May. It was pretty volatile but the most prosperous months were those. The failed outcomes almost resembles/parallels the successful line graph. But we can see that the number of succesful goals outweigh the number of failed goals.***

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    ***What we can coclude from the outcomes based on goals is that the number of succesful goals were met were higher when goals had a lower amount rather than having high prices set. This means if Louis wanted to have met more goals she should have set her goals from $1 to $4999 max. From the failed percentages data we can see that the same holds true for goals with high set prices, those failed because of how expensive the prices were.***

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    ***Some of the challenges and difficulties encountered in this challenge were the functions and some of the instructions we had to follow. I had to watch a video on countifs functions with an inequality criteria. It was tricky. But I found the right video and it helped me finish the challenge. The other diffculty encountered was that the instructions for challenge 1 wanted us to sort the columns of the pivot table. Took me 2 long minutes to figure out. Lastly the gretaest challenge encountered was this one I'm doing now, writing out my analysis.***

## Results
    ***Some of the limitations of this dataset is that there are a lot of data to analyze as their are many ways the data can be sliced. It will take a lot of time to analyze all the data. We need a better machine tool that can handle this type of data. We can create a pivot table with slicers for years or subcategories and make the table more dynamic. As for graphs I think line graphs are because bar graphs might make this data look too cluttered.***
